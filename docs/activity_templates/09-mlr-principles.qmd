# Notes

## Learning goals

Working with multiple predictors in our plots and models can get complicated!

There are no *recipes* for this process.

BUT there are some guiding *principles* that assist in long-term retention, deeper understanding, and the ability to generalize our tools in new settings.

By the end of this lesson, you should be familiar with some general *principles* for... 

- incorporating additional quantitative or categorical predictors in a visualization
- how additional quantitative or categorical predictors impact the physical representation of a model
- interpreting quantitative or categorical coefficients in a multiple regression model

# Exercises

Let's revisit the bikeshare data:

```{r}
# Load packages & import data
library(tidyverse)
bikes <- read_csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/bikeshare.csv") %>% 
  rename(rides = riders_registered)
```

Our goal is to explain / predict how registered ridership varies from day to day.

To this end, we'll build various **multiple linear regression** models of `rides` by different combinations of the possible predictors.

```{r}
# Check out the data
head(bikes)
```



## Exercise 1: Review visualization

Let's build a model of `rides` by `windspeed` (quantitative) and `weekend` status (categorical).


Plot & describe, in words, the relationship between these 3 variables.


```{r}
bikes %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = windspeed, color = weekend)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

```


## Live-Note Taking!

## Exercise 2: Review model

Let's build the model. Run the following code:

```{r}
bike_model_1 <- lm(rides ~ windspeed + weekend, data = bikes)
coef(summary(bike_model_1))
```

The estimated model formula is therefore:

E[rides | windspeed, weekendTRUE] = 4738.38 - 63.97 * windspeed - 925.16 * weekendTRUE

This model formula is represented by 2 lines, one corresponding to weekends and the other to weekdays. Simplify the model formula above for weekdays and weekends:       
    
weekdays: rides = ___ - ___ windspeed   

weekends: rides = ___ - ___ windspeed



## Exercise 3: Review coefficient interpretation


a. The intercept coefficient, 4738.38, represents the *intercept* of the sub-model for weekdays, the reference category. What's its *contextual* interpretation?
    

b. The `windspeed` coefficient, -63.97, represents the *shared slope* of the weekend and weekday sub-models. What's its *contextual* interpretation?
    

c. The `weekendTRUE` coefficient, -925.16, represents the *change in intercept* for the weekend vs weekday sub-model. What's its *contextual* interpretation?




## Exercise 4: 2 categorical predictors -- visualization

Thus far, we've explored a couple examples of multiple regression models that have 2 predictors, 1 quantitative and 1 categorical.

So what happens when *both* predictors are categorical?!

To this end, let's model `rides` by `weekend` status and `season`.

The below code plots `rides` vs `season`.

Modify this code to *also* include information about `weekend`.

HINT: Remember the visualization *principle* that additional categorical predictors require some sort of grouping mechanism / mechanism that distinguishes between the 2 groups.

```{r}
# rides vs season
bikes %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = season)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

# rides vs season AND weekend
bikes %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = season, ___ = ___)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```



## Exercise 5: follow-up

a. Describe (in words) the relationship of ridership with season & weekend status.



b. A model of `rides` by `season` alone would be represented by only 4 expected outcomes, 1 for each season. Considering this and the plot above, how do you *anticipate* a model of `rides` by `season` and `weekend` status will be represented?        
    - 2 lines, 1 for each weekend status
    - 8 lines, 1 for each possible combination of season & weekend
    - 2 expected outcomes, 1 for each weekend status
    - 8 expected outcomes, 1 for each possible combination of season & weekend
    




## Exercise 6: 2 categorical predictors -- build the model

Let's build the multiple regression model of `rides` vs `season` and `weekend`:
    
```{r}
bike_model_2 <- lm(rides ~ weekend + season, bikes)
coef(summary(bike_model_2))
```

Thus estimated model formula is given by:

E[rides | weekend, season] = 4260.45 - 912.33 weekendTRUE - 116.38 seasonspring + 438.44 seasonsummer - 1719.06 seasonwinter

a. Use this model to predict the ridership on the following days:    
    
```{r}
# a fall weekday
4260.45 - 912.33*___ - 116.38*___  + 438.44*___ - 1719.06*___

# a winter weekday    
4260.45 - 912.33*___ - 116.38*___  + 438.44*___ - 1719.06*___

# a fall weekend day        
4260.45 - 912.33*___ - 116.38*___  + 438.44*___ - 1719.06*___

# a winter weekend day
4260.45 - 912.33*___ - 116.38*___  + 438.44*___ - 1719.06*___
```



b. We only made 4 predictions here. How many *possible* predictions does this model produce? Is this consistent with your intuition in the previous exercise?






## Exercise 7: 2 categorical predictors -- interpret the model

Use your above predictions and visualization to fill in the below interpretations of the model coefficients.

Hint: What is the consequence of plugging in 0 or 1 for the different `weekend` and `season` categories?    


a. Interpreting 4260: On average, we expect there to be 4260 riders on (weekdays/weekends) during the (fall/spring/summer/winter).    

b. Interpreting -912: On average, *in any season*, we expect there to be 912 (more/fewer) riders on weekends than on ___.

c. Interpreting -1719: On average, *on both weekdays and weekends*, we expect there to be 1719 (more/fewer) riders in winter than in ___.









## Exercise 8: 2 quantitative predictors -- visualization   

Next, consider the relationship between `rides` and 2 *quantitative* predictors: `windspeed` and `temp_feel`.
Check out the plot of this relationship below which reflects the visualization *principle* that quantitative variables require some sort of numerical scaling mechanism -- `rides` and `windspeed` get numerical axes, and `temp_feel` gets a color scale:

![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/155/bikes_multivar_3.png)

Modify the code below to recreate this plot.

```{r}
bikes %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = windspeed, ___ = ___)) +
  geom_point() #color = temp_feel
```


OPTIONAL: Check out this *interactive* plot which allows us to explore this point cloud in 3D.


```{r}
# Install the "plotly" package in R Console First!
library(plotly)
bikes %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~windspeed, y = ~temp_feel, z = ~rides, 
          type = "scatter3d", 
          mode = "markers",
          marker = list(size = 5, color = ~rides, colorscale = "Viridis"))
```






## Exercise 9: follow-up

Describe (in words) the relationship of ridership with windspeed & temperature.


    






## Exercise 10: 2 quantitative predictors -- modeling

Let's build the multiple regression model of `rides` vs `windspeed` and `temp_feel`:
    
```{r}
bike_model_3 <- lm(rides ~ windspeed + temp_feel, data = bikes)
coef(summary(bike_model_3))
```

Thus estimated model formula is

E[rides | windspeed, temp_feel] = -24.06 - 36.54 windspeed + 55.52 temp_feel


a. Interpret the intercept coefficient, -24.06, in context. Is this a correct interpretation?



b. Interpret the `windspeed` coefficient, -36.54, in context. 


c. Interpret the `temp_feel` coefficient, 55.52, in context. 



    
    


## Exercise 11: Which is "best"?

We've now observed 3 different models of ridership, each having 2 predictors.
The R-squared values of these models, along with those of the simple linear regression models with each predictor alone, are summarized below.
    
model                     predictors                R-squared
------------------------- ------------------------- ------------
`bike_model_1`            `windspeed` & `weekend`   0.119
`bike_model_2`            `weekend` & `season`      0.349
`bike_model_3`            `windspeed` & `temp_feel` 0.310
`bike_model_4`            `windspeed`               0.047
`bike_model_5`            `temp_feel`               0.296
`bike_model_6`            `weekend`                 0.074
`bike_model_7`            `season`                  0.279


a. Which model does the best job of explaining the variability in ridership from day to day?


b. If you could only pick one predictor, which would it be?


c. What happens to R-squared when we add a second predictor to our model, and why does this make sense? For example, how does the R-squared for model 1 (with both `windspeed` and `weekend`) compare to those of model 4 (only `windspeed`) and model 6 (only `weekend`)?


d. Are 2 predictors always better than 1? Provide evidence and explain why this makes sense.

## Exercise 8: 2 quantitative predictors â€“ visualization


```{r eval = TRUE}
bikes %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = windspeed, color = temp_feel)) + 
  geom_point() 
```




## Exercise 9: follow-up

Ridership tends to increase with temperature (no matter the windspeed) and decrease with windspeed (no matter the temperature).



## Exercise 10: 2 quantitative predictors â€“ modeling

a. -24.06 = average ridership on days with 0 windspeed and a 0 degree temperature. (Note: this is a *correct* interpretation, even though it doesn't make conceptual sense! The model doesn't know that ridership can't be negative!)

b. At any temperature, a 1mph increase in windspeed is associated with a 37 rider decrease in average ridership.

c. At any windspeed, a 1 degree increase in temperature is associated with a 56 rider increase in average ridership.


## Exercise 11: Which is best?

a. model 2
b. temperature
c. R-squared increases (our model is stronger when we include another predictor)
d. nope. model 1 (with windspeed and weekend) has a lower R-squared than model 5 (with only temperature)

## Exercise 13: Practice 1    

```{r eval = TRUE}
bikes %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = weekend, fill = weather_cat)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

new_model_1 <- lm(rides ~ weekend + weather_cat, bikes)
coef(summary(new_model_1))
```



- The average ridership on a *weekday* with *nice* weather (categ1) is 4212 rides.    

- On days with the same weather, the average ridership is 982 less on a weekend than on a weekday.

- On any day of the week, the average ridership is 609 less on dreary days than on nice days.

\
\




## Exercise 14: Practice 2    
    
```{r eval = TRUE}
bikes %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = temp_feel, color = humidity)) + 
    geom_point()

new_model_2 <- lm(rides ~ temp_feel + humidity, bikes)
coef(summary(new_model_2))
```

- On average, there are 316 riders on days with 0 humidity that feel like 0 degrees.

- At any humidity, a 1 degree increase in ridership is associated with a 60 ride increase in average ridership.

- At any temperature, a 1 percentage point increase in humidity (i.e. a 0.1 increase in `humidity`) is associated with a 187 decrease in average ridership.


\
\




## Exercise 15: Practice 3

```{r eval = TRUE}
new_model_3 <- lm(rides ~ temp_feel + weather_cat, bikes)
coef(summary(new_model_3))

bikes %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = temp_feel, color = weather_cat)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(aes(y = new_model_3$fitted.values), size = 1.5)
```

- On average, there are -289 riders on nice weather days that feel like 0 degrees. (Note: this is a *correct* interpretation, even though it doesn't make conceptual sense!)

- On days with the same weather, a 1 degree increase in temperature is associated with a 55 ride increase in average ridership.

- On days with the same temperature, average ridership is 386 rides lower on a dreary weather day than on a nice weather day.



## Exercise 16: CHALLENGE

   
```{r eval = TRUE}
bikes %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = temp_feel, color = humidity, size = weekend)) + 
  geom_point()

new_model_4 <- lm(rides ~ temp_feel + humidity + weekend, bikes)
coef(summary(new_model_4))
```

- On average, there are 669 riders on weekdays that feel like 0 degrees and have no humidity.

- On days with the same humidity levels and time of the week, a 1 degree increase in temperature is associated with a 59 ride increase in average ridership.

- On days with the same temperature and time of the week, a 0.1 point increase in humidity levels (i.e. a 1 percentage point increase in humidity) is associated with a 190.6 ride decrease in average ridership.

- On days with the same temperature and humidity, the average ridership is 869 rides lower on weekends compared to weekdays.

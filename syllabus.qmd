## Overview

This course provides an introduction to statistical modeling. In other words, you will develop the basic skills to **analyze data**, **test research hypotheses**, and **make predictions** about the world.

Being able to **summarize**, **interpret**, and **communicate** about data are crucial for navigating today's information landscape, and these are precisely the skills that we'll build in this class. Throughout the semester, we'll study the fundamental methods that statisticians use to extract knowledge from data, emphasizing statistical literacy & intuition, real data applications, and modern computing over memorizing facts and formulas.

### Learning goals

By actively participating in this course, you will develop and/or strengthen your abilities to:

-   **Visualize**: explore, understand, and describe patterns in data with plots and graphics

-   **Model**: build, interpret, and evaluate statistical models to identify trends in data

-   **Infer**: extend observations from sample data to draw conclusions and make predictions

-   **Compute**: use the (free!) statistical software R to analyze real data and create reproducible reports

-   **Contextualize**: interpret results in context, by considering the methods of data collection, the scientific and social contexts, and ethical dimensions

-   **Communicate**: accurately describe methods and results in a way that is scientifically sound and widely accessible

-   **Collaborate**: work productively and effectively in a group setting

### Required resources

#### Textbook

There is no required textbook for this course. Throughout the course, readings may be assigned from these notes, or other sources. All links and materials needed will be provided on the [Schedule](schedule.qmd) tab of this website.

The best resources for this course are course content videos, attending and participating in class / assignments, and office hours. I am happy to talk about possible additional materials / strategies for effective learning at any time throughout the semester!

#### Statistical software

We will use the (completely free and open source) R programming language extensively throughout this course. RStudio (an interface for R) will facilitate our use of R. You may use RStudio in one of two ways:

1.  Desktop version: Download for Windows or Mac at <https://posit.co/downloads/>. Note: You first need to download and install R on your computer in order to use the desktop version of RStudio

2.  Online: Go to <https://rstudio.macalester.edu>, and log in with your full Mac email address and your usual Mac password to get access. (Note that this is a shared resource across MSCS, and you may experience performance issues due to high traffic, server outages, etc.)

More detailed instructions on downloading, installing, and getting started with R, RStudio, and an important package called Quarto is available on the [Tech Setup](tech_setup.qmd) tab.

### What to expect in and out of class

When taking a new course, figuring out the right workflow/cadence of effort throughout the week can be a big adjustment. And most of you are doing this for 4 different courses! Below are some suggestions for what to expect in the course and how to focus your time and attention during and outside of class.

#### Outside of class

**Pre-class videos/readings:** Some class periods will have required videos or reading to get acquainted with new concepts before seeing them again in class. My goal for these videos and readings is for you to get the most out of class time by being able to more easily follow explanations in class and to engage most fully in class activities. When there are required readings or videos, there will be an associated checkpoint to complete on Moodle (due 30 minutes before the start of the next class).

::: {.callout-tip title="Suggestions"}
-   As you take notes on videos/readings, highlight or otherwise mark all the areas where you have questions. Gather up all of these questions in one place, and bring them to class with you.
-   Record any reflections from in-class time about your learning process or interactions with peers while they are still fresh.
-   After learning a new topic in class, it is helpful to attempt the upcoming assignment as soon as possible. Just by getting some rough ideas down quickly, you avoid the difficulty of starting from a blank slate.
-   Come to instructor and preceptor drop-in hours (office hours) to chat about the course or anything else!
:::

#### During class

Class time will be a mix of interactive lecture and longer stretches of group work. During the lecture portion, I will pause explanation frequently to prompt a short exercise or ask questions that you'll reflect on individually or together.

::: {.callout-tip title="Suggestions"}
-   As we review the material at the start of class and as you work on the class activity, reference your set of questions from the pre-class material. Have you made progress on addressing those questions? Who or what helped with improving your understanding, and how?

# Communication

## Course website

All course materials will be posted on the [course website](https://carjed.github.io/155_spring_2025). The [Schedule tab](schedule.qmd) of this website will contain information about due dates, in-class activities, etc.

## Moodle

Moodle will be used to submit assignments/checkpoint quizzes, post grades, assignment feedback, announcements, and more. Please check the course Moodle page every day before class!

## Email

Please send any personal questions or administrative updates (e.g., attendance, accommodations) to me via email. **Please put "STAT 155" in the subject line of all emails** to help ensure that it does not get lost in my inbox!

I will generally not respond to emails outside of business hours (9am-5pm M-F). Please **allow 1 business day for a response** (e.g. an email sent on Friday may not get a response until the following Monday).

Any urgent announcements (e.g. unexpected class cancellations, notice of modifications to assignments) will be made over email.

## Drop-in (office) hours {#drop-in-office-hours}

Office hours are an open-ended time for you to go over coursework, clarify concepts, solicit my ~~biased opinions~~ sage wisdom on career planning/graduate school, discuss research/internship opportunities, find resources you need, or chat about life in general. To encourage attendance at office hours, **there may be individual and/or collective incentives along the way and/or at the end of the semester**, depending on how well you utilize office hours (but please be respectful of your peers and do not monopolize this time).

::: {.callout-note title="First time office hours user?"}
If you are nervous about coming to office hours for the first time, I encourage you to **come with a friend!** (they don't even have to be enrolled in STAT 155!). You may also find it useful to come prepared with a specific question or topic you would like to discuss (some examples [here](https://studentlife.uoregon.edu/node/149)--and remember, it does not have to be about STAT 155 material!).
:::

## Preceptors

We have many preceptors for STAT 155 this semester! You may attend office hours for any of the STAT 155 preceptors, not just those grading/attending my sections. All MSCS courses will also share a dedicated R preceptor (Kyle Suelflow), who can help with any issues you have with your R code or RStudio configuration. The course Moodle site contains detailed information for preceptor office hour times/locations.

The role of an MSCS preceptor is to help students with content questions, assist in the navigation of available resources, advise on studying approaches for classes, and assist with concepts, tools, and skills needed for problem sets. Students are accountable for their own learning; as such, preceptors are not allowed to share answers to assignments (unless specifically directed by the instructor), are not expected to immediately know the right approach, or provide assistance outside of office hours. Guidelines and expectations on how to interact with preceptors can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1USu-3R1NsGDVm0yU0HTzHuTpzCD3onBjNI5n8w9VBik/edit?usp=sharing).

In addition, the Macalester Academic Excellence (MAX) Center provides tutoring for STAT 155. Check out their [website](https://www.macalester.edu/max/science-quantitative-support/stats/) for more information and their tutoring schedule.

# Grading and feedback

## Course grading system

Your overall course grade will consist of three, evenly-weighted components (Quizzes, Practice Problems, and the Project), **modified by** your Checkpoint Quiz completion.

-   33% Quizzes
-   33% Practice Problems
-   33% Project

Overall percentages will correspond to the following letter grades:

| Letter Grade | Overall Course Percentage |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| A            | \>90%                     |
| A-           | 87-90%                    |
| B+           | 84-87%                    |
| B            | 81-84%                    |
| B-           | 78-81%                    |
| C+           | 75-78%                    |
| C            | 72-75%                    |
| C-           | 69-72%                    |
| D            | \<69%                     |

Note that I may slightly relax the cutoffs for letter grades on a case-by-case basis, depending on your overall engagement in class, utilization of office hours, demonstrated growth, completion of >80% of Moodle checkpoints, etc.

### Quizzes

There will be 3 quizzes over the course of the semester.

-   Quiz 1: Thursday, 2/13. 1 hour in class.
-   Quiz 2: Thursday, 3/27. 1 hour in class. Will cover material from the first quiz to some extent because of the way that material in this course builds on earlier ideas.
-   Quiz 3: Final exam period. The quiz will be written to take 1.25 hours, but you will have the full two hour period to complete it. Will cover content from the whole course.
  -   Section 02: Fri. 5/9 8:00am-10:00am
  -   Section 03: Thurs. 5/8 1:30pm-3:30pm
  -   Section 04: Sat. 5/10 10:30am-12:30pm

Quiz format:

-   Fully pen/pencil and paper. You will not need to write code or use a calculator, but you will need to be able to read and interpret output from R code.
-   You are allowed to bring a 3x5 index card with notes written on both sides. Typing your notes and pasting them on the card is fine.

**Showing growth:** You can earn up to 50% of missed points back on quizzes if you submit a quiz correction and reflection. You must:

-   Write a reflection of how you prepared for the quiz and where you felt strongest and more uncertain in your understanding before taking the quiz.
-   Submit your quiz corrections along with your reflection to the instructor, no later than one week after quizzes have been handed back.

You will not have the option to earn points back on the third quiz, due to time constraints at the end of the semester, so I encourage you to make full use of the reflection opportunities on the first two quizzes!

### Practice problems

There will be 8 practice problem sets throughout the course, building off of topics learned in videos/our in-class activities. Practice problems will be due on Wednesdays at 5pm. You are encouraged to work together on practice problems, but the work that you submit, including code, should be your own.

You will receive qualitative feedback on all questions on these practice problem sets. Each question (or occasionally, parts of a question) will receive an overall score on the following scale:

- High pass: 2 points
- Pass: 1 point
- Needs improvement: 0 points

Thus, the number of overall points on a given Practice Problem may vary depending on the length of the assignment. **Your lowest practice problem score will be dropped from your final grade, so long as you have submitted all 8 practice problems and demonstrated effort on each one.**

### Group Project

The goal of the course project is to apply the data analysis skills from our course to collaboratively investigate a research question in a dataset of your choosing. Through milestones over the course of the semester, you will make steady progress on your projects and iterate on feedback. Full details about the project will be available on the [Project page](project.qmd).

### Checkpoints

Some class periods will have readings and/or videos assigned ahead of time. For these classes, there will be a short multiple-choice Moodle checkpoint, due by the end of the day. I strongly encourage you to complete the checkpoints before class, but you have the option to complete them after class if you find that doing so helps you review & retain the material better.

These short quizzes are designed to ensure that you stay on top of course material, since we move very quickly and much of the content in this course builds on itself.

Checkpoint quizzes are graded for completion. If you complete 80% of the checkpoint quizzes before the time they are due, your overall course grade will not be negatively affected. If you complete less than 80% of the checkpoint quizzes before the time they are due, your overall course grade will be lowered by 1/3 of a letter grade (i.e. B → B-, A- → B+, etc.).

# Other policies

## Attendance

Attendance is not (directly) a part of your grade—I recognize that some students may learn more effectively when working through the material independently, and mandating attendance can create a barrier to accessibility. However, because this course is designed to be interactive and community-oriented, regular attendance will likely improve your experience and help you get the most out of the course (remember, that encompasses lots of intangible benefits beyond your final grade!).

If you do miss class, I expect you to complete any in-class activities on your own. Check the solutions in the online manual and come to office hours with any follow-up questions.

## Late work

Throughout the semester, you may use up to three, three-day extensions. These three extensions can be used on Problem Sets only, not quizzes. The purpose of deadlines (and extensions) are to keep you accountable for your own learning, to keep you on track with the pace of the course (which builds upon itself throughout the semester), and to provide preceptors and myself with the ability to provide you with timely feedback on assignments. Since the Problem Sets are due roughly every two weeks, you must begin working on them early if you want to succeed.

Extensions can be used automatically, without letting me know in advance. The Moodle dropboxes for assignments will close exactly 3 days after the original deadline (i.e. Saturdays at 5pm), and I will not accept work submitted after that point unless there are extenuating circumstances that you have communicated with me about ahead of the original deadline. If you email me a completed assignment after a 3-day extension is up, I may have the preceptors provide you with feedback, but you will not receive credit for the assignment (equivalent to “Needs Improvement” on every question of the relevant assignment).

I expect you to keep track of how many extensions you’ve used. I will do my best to email you a reminder if you have used all three of your extensions and have none remaining.

If you have run out of extensions and/or an extenuating circumstance occurs that impacts your ability to submit assignments on time, please email me to discuss the situation. **I am happy to be flexible as long as you communicate!**

## Religious Observance

Students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during the semester. If you have a religious observance/practice that conflicts with your participation in the course, please contact me before the end of the second week of the semester to discuss appropriate accommodations.

## Academic integrity

Academic integrity is the cornerstone of our learning community. Students are expected to be familiar with the [college's standards](http://www.macalester.edu/academicprograms/academicpolicies/academicintegrity/) on academic integrity.

I encourage you to work with your classmates to discuss material and ideas for assignments, but in order for you to receive individualized feedback on your own learning, you must submit your own work. This involves writing your own code and putting explanations into your own words. Always cite any sources you use, including AI (see section below).

## Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use

In this course, I *strongly discourage* the use of generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude, etc.), for three main reasons:

1.  We are learning the essentials of a new language and way of thinking. Learning how to do something the "long" or "hard" way is beneficial not only for developing critical thinking skills, but because that process can be enriching and fulfilling in its own right. Though AI can (sometimes) put access to answers at your fingertips, it cannot replace the *physical, sensory, and emotional* experience of sketching out ideas on a whiteboard with friends, [stopping by your professor's office for a donut](#drop-in-office-hours), or the satisfaction of knowing that you can do something hard from scratch.

2.  I care much more about developing your ability to identify interesting problems, iteratively seek a solution, and convince the world that your solution works than I do about your ability to find answers that are already known (using AI or otherwise). Remember that "generative" AI is only capable of remixing existing information—it cannot *create* new knowledge, situate that knowledge in the context of your lived experience, or apply that knowledge to instigate change.

3.  In this course, I hope to emphasize the importance of **process** over **output**. Consider an analogy of a painting class at Macalester. You're a novice painter, but you have a strong point of view and a solid understanding of context and tradition, so you decide to write an AI prompt to generate the artwork and translate it to physical media. After lots of wordsmithing and iterations on Midjourney, your AI-generated image ready. It's provocative and beautiful...it will look even better on canvas! You get to work, admiring yourself for finishing faster than your classmates because you knew *exactly* what your final product would look like. You step back to admire your masterpiece, and realize it's at best a paint-by-numbers, and at worst, complete garbage because you were so focused on crafting the perfect AI prompt that you didn't really learn how to mix colors or use different brush techniques.

All of that being said, I have neither the time nor interest in policing the use of AI tools. **If you do choose to use AI**, any ideas, language, or code that is produced by AI must be cited, just like any other resource. 

- **How to cite AI:** If you have used AI in any assignment, please include a paragraph at the end explaining what you used the AI for and what prompts you used to get the results. Failure to do so is in violation of the academic integrity policy at Macalester College.

<br><br><br><br>

## Well-being

I want you to succeed. Both here at Macalester and beyond. To help make this happen, I am committed to the following.

**Respect:** Everyone comes from a different path through life, and it is our moral duty as human beings to listen to each other without judgment and to respect one another. I have no tolerance for discrimination of any kind, in and out of the classroom. If you are seeking campus resources regarding discrimination, the [Department of Multicultural Life](https://www.macalester.edu/multiculturallife/) and the [Center for Religious and Spiritual Life](https://www.macalester.edu/religiouslife/) are wonderful resources. We will also respect the [MSCS Community Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSlLLWmyOf8WKGDKJ_qypgA_kQI1dNFGEKH0mtFoqfAUARZN7ypVCgivnmPjccks9jJzW1rgEzt7QMI/pub).

**Sensitive Topics:** Applications in this course span issues in science, policy, and society. As such, we may sometimes address sensitive topics. I will try to announce in class if an assignment or activity involves a potentially sensitive topic. If you have reservations about a particular topic, please come talk to me to discuss possible options.

**Accommodations:** If you need accommodations for any reason, please contact [Disability Services](https://www.macalester.edu/studentaffairs/disabilityservices/accommodations/) to discuss your needs, and speak with me as soon as possible afterwards so that we can discuss your accommodation plan. If you already have official accommodations, please discuss these with me within the first week of class so that you get off to a great start. Contact me if you have other special circumstances. I will find resources for you.

**Title IX:** You deserve a community free from discrimination, sexual harassment, hostility, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. If you or anyone you know has experienced harassment or discrimination, know that you are not alone. Macalester provides staff and resources to help you find support. **Please be aware that as a faculty member, it is my responsibility to report disclosure about sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, relationship violence, and stalking to the Title IX Office.** The purpose of this report is to ensure that anyone experiencing harm receives the resources and support they need. I will keep this information private, and it will not be shared beyond this required report.

You may also contact Macalester’s Title IX Coordinator directly (phone: 651-696-6258; e-mail: titleixcordinator\@macalester.edu); they will provide you with supportive measures, resources, and referrals. Additional information about how to file a report (including anonymously) is available on the [Title IX website](https://www.macalester.edu/titleix/).

**General Health and Well-being:** I care that you prioritize your well-being in this semester and beyond. Investing time into taking care of yourself will have profound impacts on all aspects of your life. Remember that beyond being a student, you are a human being carrying your own experiences, thoughts, emotions, and identities. It is important to acknowledge any stressors you may be facing, which can be mental, emotional, physical, cultural, financial, etc., and how they can have an impact on you. I encourage you to remember that you have a body with needs. In the classroom, eat when you are hungry, drink water, use the restroom, and step out if you are upset and need some air. Please do what is necessary so long as it does not impede your or others' ability to be mentally and emotionally present in the course. Outside of the classroom, sleeping well, moving your body, and connecting with others can be strategies can help nourish you. If you are having difficulties maintaining your well-being, please don't hesitate to contact me and/or find support from physical and mental health resources [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lz-ii5yze_OSkQJqz_7pap7fRjG81LJh0_saBniP-zg/edit), [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iC-ykD8QJ-w2BVO1Gb0AobD-00Zq_8mznWR5C2mNiF0/edit?usp=sharing), and [here](https://www.macalester.edu/current-students/).

# Guiding Values / Course Manifesto

## You belong here!

Statistics--like most other areas of science--has a long history of excluding and exploiting people from marginalized communities and identities. Many of the earliest statisticians in the 19th and 20th centuries used and abused statistics to justify [colonialism, ableism, classism, sexism, eugenics, and white supremacy](https://nautil.us/how-eugenics-shaped-statistics-238014/).

On top of this problematic history, cultural norms around academic performance in quantitative disciplines can make courses like this one feel intimidating and exclusionary, rather than collaborative and interdisciplinary.

To counter these barriers, my central goal as an instructor is to **intentionally foster community and connectedness.** I believe that your unique voices and perspectives in this class will enrich our collective learning process and, in turn, your college experience. I encourage you to get to know your classmates ([and me!](#drop-in-office-hours)) beyond a superficial familiarity and connect over our shared interests, identities, and ideas. You can help cultivate that community by being thoughtful about the way you engage with others and stretching your comfort zone to interact with people who are outside of your established social circles.

## Informed skepticism

In virtually all of contemporary Western science, statistical reasoning is foundational to establishing trust in scientific theories. However, it is shockingly common to encounter "statistically justified" conclusions that are 1) not generalizable or cannot be replicated, 2) invalidated by honest coding/modeling mistakes, 3) based on deliberately cherry-picked models, or--in extreme cases--4) data that have been outright fabricated/falsified. Like in all aspects of life, trust in scientific claims must be earned.

In this course and beyond, I encourage you to approach any statistical results you encounter with a healthy skepticism, informed by both your gut intuition and the material you've learned. Know that [you may be wrong](#mistakes-and-uncertainty-are-essential) (counter-intuitive results are abundant!) but you should **always** feel empowered to respectfully and rigorously challenge statistical claims.

## A commitment to ethical deliberation and conduct

Because statistics is a way to make sense of the world around us, it is also a way to influence it. This comes with an inherent responsibility to grapple with the ethical and sociopolitical dimensions of the content in this course. This includes delving into the context of how methods were developed, questioning assumptions, and considering the potential for misuse and misinterpretation. Throughout the course, you will be challenged to consider the broader impact of your work: How might your results and interpretations directly or indirectly affect the environment, specific individuals, or human culture & society? Whose prior scientific contributions are you amplifying or ignoring? How do your assumptions and biases shape your scientific approach and communication?

## Mistakes and uncertainty are essential {#mistakes-and-uncertainty-are-essential}

I expect that you and I will make lots of mistakes along the way in this course. Perhaps paradoxically, this is an important way to gain confidence: as we *make* mistakes, we will develop skills for *recognizing* and correcting them. These skills are **vital** for succeeding in STEM careers (and life in general). This course will provide a low-stakes environment for us to practice accountability, reflection, and troubleshooting when mistakes occur.

## Context before content

Rigorous statistical reasoning demands that we understand the context of our data and our research questions before we run a model and obtain/interpret results. I also aim to be mindful of various other contexts that shape our learning experience: our individual identities/histories, the classroom environment, the campus climate, etc. Throughout the semester, we will create space to address and discuss whatever contexts might impact our ability to engage the material (and how they may even relate to the material!).

# Note

This syllabus is subject to change at any time! Announcements of changes will be made in class or via email.

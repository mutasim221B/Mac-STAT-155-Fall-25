Macalester College, Fall 2025

-   **Section 03**: M/W/F 09:40-10:40am, THTR 002
-   **Section 04**: M/W/F 12:00-01:00pm, THTR 202

**Welcome to STAT 155!** Whether in life or research, we’re often interested in relationships between 2+ variables. For example, how is one’s commute time to class related to their distance from campus and mode of transportation? Or, how is voter participation related to a person’s age and political affiliation? **Statistical modeling** is the art and science of turning data into information about such relationships of interest.

Being able to **summarize**, **interpret**, and **communicate** about data are crucial for navigating today's information landscape, and these are precisely the skills that we'll build in this class. Throughout the semester, we'll study the fundamental methods that statisticians use to extract knowledge from data, emphasizing statistical literacy & intuition, real data applications, and modern computing over memorizing facts and formulas.

## Learning Objectives

### Important technical concepts

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:

-  Build, use, and interpret **graphical and numerical summaries** of data.

-  Given a research question: **identify** an appropriate model, use sample data to **fit** the model in RStudio (free!), **evaluate** the model’s quality, and **quantify** our uncertainty in the model’s coefficients and predictions.

-  Use a sample model to make **predictions & inferences** about a population, using **prediction/confidence intervals & hypothesis tests**.

-  **Interpret & communicate** an analysis in context & using appropriate notation, argumentation, & evidence.

-   Describe potential **advantages, limitations, and ethical considerations** of a data set and statistical analysis.

-  Identify **common pitfalls** in statistical analyses (e.g., spurious correlation vs. causal relationships, extrapolation, multicollinearity, multiple testing, practical vs. statistical significance).

-   Accurately **describe methods and results** in a way that is scientifically sound and widely accessible.

-   Work **productively and effectively** in a group setting.

### Important statistical skills

The following skills are essential both within and beyond Statistics, and demonstrably improve your own learning and the learning of those around you:
- Move beyond a “homework only” study approach. Develop a deeper understanding of the material through **continued review, reflection, and practice**.
- Think **creatively, and build confidence**, applying course concepts in open-ended, novel settings.
- Be comfortable working through **challenges and mistakes**.
- Contribute to a **welcoming and engaged learning environment**.
- Work effectively in a **group setting**.

::: {.callout-note title="Notes from \"your professor\""}
Greetings! You can call me *Bill* or *Professor Billah* & I use he/him pronouns. Back when I was an undergrad student, I didn’t have the best experience in Intro Stat—those courses often emphasized formulas over real understanding. That experience has shaped my teaching—I concentrate on illustrating how statistical theories connect and can be applied in the real world. I’m excited to teach STAT 155 and to create a more meaningful experience—one that helps all students feel confident applying it beyond the classroom. My methodological research lies at the intersection of statistical genetics, biostatistics, and genomics. My current research interests include developing novel statistical methods and computationally efficient bioinformatics tools, leveraging modern machine- and deep-learning approaches analyze high-dimensional next-generation sequencing and multi-omics data to identify genes and regulatory mechanisms underlying complex diseases. 
Outside of my academic work, I enjoy spending time outdoors with family and friends or cooking variety of foods. If you can’t find me anywhere, I might be busy playing soccer or exploring new worlds on my PS5 Pro!

### About your preceptors

We have several wonderful STAT 155 preceptors this semester! Their role is to help students
with content questions, assist in the navigation of available resources, advise on studying approaches, and assist with concepts, tools, and skills. Students are accountable for their own learning; as such, preceptors are not allowed to share answers to assignments (unless specifically directed by the instructor), they are not expected to immediately know the right approach to an exercise, and they do not provide assistance outside of office hours.

In hiring preceptors, we prioritize and emphasize kindness and respect. I expect the same of students in their interactions with the preceptors. Please utilize and respect their experience and commitment to supporting you in this course. Please check out some [additional guidelines and expectations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1USu-3R1NsGDVm0yU0HTzHuTpzCD3onBjNI5n8w9VBik/edit?tab=t.0) on how to interact with preceptors.

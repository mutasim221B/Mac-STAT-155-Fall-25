## Getting Help

- [Crowd-sourced R functions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ziidS98vvWUepaV5NypuPvLuko6rxBdm/edit#heading=h.m021w4b7p4ld)
- Interactive RStudio tutorials: <https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes> (R basics, data viz, and more)
- Markdown (Quarto) basics: <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html>, and Quarto/RStudio tutorial: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html>
- RStudio cheatsheets: <https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/>
- **Google it!** If you have a question about R, someone else probably asked it. Add **“R tidyverse”** to your search term.  
  Example: *scatterplot R tidyverse*
- **Note about ChatGPT for code**: Please avoid using ChatGPT as a first resort for R code. It often suggests overly wordy or unfamiliar approaches. Our goal is for you to understand the code you write; sticking to tools and syntax we use in class will support your learning best.
